Friendship Relationships: In platforms like Facebook, each user can be considered a node, and their friendships as edges. An adjacency list efficiently stores and processes these relationships.
Followers/Following: In Twitter, an adjacency list can represent who follows whom, making it easier to recommend followers or find mutual followers.
